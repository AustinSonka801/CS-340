How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To ensure the software is readily maintainable, comprehensible, and flexible, I design it with easy transferability and modularity in mind. A case in point is the CRUD module utilized in Project One, which seamlessly integrates with both Project One and Project Two, enabling smooth data reading, updating, and deletion from the database. Embracing modularity not only enhances development efficiency but also results in applications that are easily debugged and fixed.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I adopt a primary approach of critical thinking when working with software. My process begins with a thorough analysis of the problem at hand, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the requirements. Next, I evaluate various potential solutions and determine the most effective one to address the challenge. To ensure a robust outcome, I create test cases with specific pass and fail criteria for each requirement. These test cases become the foundation for developing tools that can tackle the challenges head-on. Once the tools are in place, I proceed with implementing the test cases and diligently debug the new application. I am committed to continuing this method to consistently deliver high-quality applications and software

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists encounter challenges, analyze and interpret them, and then proceed to test their proposed solutions. This systematic approach holds significant importance as it enables the creation of high-quality and user-friendly software that can be delivered to clients with confidence. The process of attempting to find solutions to these challenges serves as a valuable learning and growth experience. Moreover, developing software in a modular manner provides a shortcut for companies in the future, as it allows for the easy replacement or implementation of modules elsewhere. This approach saves time and resources for companies like Grazioso Salvare.
